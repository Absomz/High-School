## 📌 Purpose

This repository is a complete academic portfolio that documents my entire high school experience across all four grades — from 9th to 12th — organized by subject and instructional module.

It was created to:
- Provide full visibility into my intellectual and academic growth.
- Demonstrate my discipline and strategic thinking as a future engineer and scientist.
- Serve as a technical and conceptual foundation for my `first-data-insights` and future AI development work.
